## ðŸ§  Detailed Prompt Descriptions

### 1. `1-zero-shot.txt` â€“ Zero-Shot Prompt
**Strategy**: Minimal instruction, no examples.  
**Goal**: Have the model infer how to extract fields purely from directive text.  
**Use Case**: Baseline testing and quick prototyping.

---

### 2. `2-out-sch-def.txt` â€“ Output Schema Definition
**Strategy**: Defines a fixed JSON schema.  
**Goal**: Forces structured outputs with field alignment.  
**Use Case**: When working with contract-driven systems or post-processing validators.

---

### 3. `3-few-shot.txt` â€“ Few-Shot Prompt
**Strategy**: Includes a successful example for the model to learn from.  
**Goal**: Improve extraction reliability by imitation.  
**Use Case**: Recommended when documents are multilingual or follow varied templates.

---

### 4. `4-cot-persona.txt` â€“ Chain-of-Thought Persona
**Strategy**: Uses a role-playing assistant to explain steps before final output.  
**Goal**: Transparency in reasoning with intermediate thoughts.  
**Use Case**: Debugging, research, or model interpretability.

---

### 5. `5-ocr-focused-instruction.txt` â€“ OCR-Focused Prompt
**Strategy**: Addresses documents with handwriting or cursive fonts.  
**Goal**: Ensure no field is skipped due to font/scan artifacts.  
**Use Case**: Scanned or stylized invoices (e.g., handwritten receipts).

---

### 6. `6-self-validation-out-constraints.txt` â€“ Self-Validating Output
**Strategy**: Applies arithmetic and logical checks after data extraction.  
**Goal**: Catch common errors in totals, item calculations, and date formatting.  
**Use Case**: High-confidence pipelines and financial audits.

---

### 7. `7-inv-extraction-specialist.txt` â€“ Invoice Extraction Specialist
**Strategy**: Expert assistant with strict extraction rules.  
**Goal**: Precision with null-return logic for missing fields.  
**Use Case**: Production pipelines or client-facing invoice systems.

## âœ… Recommended Pairings

You can combine prompts for improved reliability:

- **CoT + Validation** â†’ `4` + `6`: Enables reasoning **with** rule checking.
- **OCR + Specialist** â†’ `5` + `7`: Best for scanned invoices with accuracy guarantees.

## ðŸš€ Deployment Tip

Use these prompts with any LLM or API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) by injecting the prompt content as the system/user input. Set `temperature = 0` for deterministic behavior.
